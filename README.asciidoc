== Sample 

Here is a sample _pom.xml_ configuration :

    <build>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>com.worldline.maven</groupId>
          <artifactId>openshift-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
          <configuration>
            <password>${openshift.password}</password>
            <domain>myDomain</domain>
            <application>myApplication</application>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </build>

then to deploy on OpenShift simply execute:

    mvn clean package openshift:update-application

=== IT Tests

To run integration tests, please read BaseIT requirements (ex. set openshift.serverUrl). 

To avoid ITs :

    mvn clean install -DskipITs=true

Here is an example to include ITs :

    mvn clean install -Dopenshift.serverUrl=broker.mydomain.fr
